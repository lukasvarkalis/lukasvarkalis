## Engineering Managers' README

<div style="margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem">
  This is a quick guide to working with me. This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea  of what’s inside my head& heart at work & life instead.
</div>

### Responsibilities

<div style="margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem">
  From my point of view, conflicts are raising from different expectations or interpretations, so I am always open to hear what you are expecting from me and I also share what I’m expecting from others.

Quality assurance is not only mine, yours or QA engineer responsibility - it's everyones.

</div>

### Values

<div style="margin-left: 1rem">

**People first** - my primary goal is to create a healthy environment within my team and organization. I believe that happy, informed, and productive people can create unbelievable things.

**Autonomy** - I always try to trust other people and give my teammates responsibility. I presume they can make great decisions.

**Openness** - I make information available to everyone. I dare to say this allows us to move faster and builds trust between team members.

</div>

### Communication style

<div style="margin-left: 1rem">
  I do admit that I usually respond slowly to written communication. Since I tend to concentrate on what I’m doing and put everything else aside -  if you need a quick response, please feel free to voice-call me.

Nonetheless, I enjoy communicating via group chat. If it’s not personal, let’s use a shared Slack channel where everyone can see all the information or answer your questions. Wouldn’t you agree it’s more productive this way?

Oh and lastly, I always expect a clear agenda provided for my meetings as well as to walk away with clear takeaways. If we don’t have what to take from it, do we really need it?

</div>

### 1:1s

<div style="margin-left: 1rem">
Personally, I prefer scheduling 1:1 meetings weekly for at least 30 minutes.

After a few calls, you can get bored of me starting meetings with "How are you?". However, the goal of this 1:1 is to discuss topic of substance - not the status updates.

But hey - it's also your time! So always feel free to add agenda of what you like to discuss.

</div>

### Feedback

<div style="margin-left: 1rem">
I feel like feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

Usually, I prefer to share feedback instantly: even it’s pleasant to hear or not that much - let’s not wait for a specific meeting but learn instantly from our mistakes on the go.

I’m always open and interested in hearing feedback to my side as well. Providing feedback requires your courage and so it allows me to grow - I highly appreciate it.

</div>

### Growth

<div style="margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem">
  While working together we will learn a lot of from each other.  I can only promise to do everything what’s in my power to help you meet raised goals and achieve your dream position.

Knowledge-sharing sessions and workshops could help us get there, so suggestions or initiatives are more than welcome anytime. Let me help you!

And of course, if you have found article or resource which could be interesting for others too -- let's share it with everyone. Sharing is caring, right?
