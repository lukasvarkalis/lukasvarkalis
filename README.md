I'm engineering manager & software engineer Lukas Varklis ✌️

## Engineering Managers' README

This is a quick guide to working with me. I will tell you about myself so that we can get to know each other faster and achieve great success together.

> This document is in DRAFT and I constantly trying to add more information

### My values

**People first** - my primary goal is to create a healthy environment within my team and organization. I believe that happy, informed, and productive people create great things.

**Autonomy** - I always try to trust other people and give my teammates responsibility. I believe they can make great decisions.

**Openness** - I make information available to everyone. I believe this allows us to move faster and builds trust between team members.

### Communication style

I usually respond slowly to written communication because I like to concentrate on what I am doing. However, if you need a quick response, please feel free to call me.

I like to communicate via group chat. If it’s not personal, let’s use a shared Slack channel where everyone can see all the information or answer your questions. I think it’s more productive.

I always expect an agenda for my meetings and hope to walk away with clear takeaways.

### 1-1

I schedule 1:1 meetings weekly for at least 30 minutes.

I like to start those meetings from "How are you?". The goal of this 1:1 is to discuss topic of substance, not status updates.

It's also your time! So always feel free to add agenda what you like to discuss
